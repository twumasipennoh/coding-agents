# /deploy — Automated Deploy Skill

Deploy the current project to its target environment. Defaults to nonprod.

> **Pipeline announcements required.** This skill is a multi-step pipeline. Announce every non-interactive step via `~/.claude/scripts/pipeline-step.sh` per the rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md § "Pipeline step announcements"`. Use pipeline-id `deploy`, display name `Deploy`, step labels as shown in the section headings below (e.g. `Pre-Deploy Checks`, `Deploy`, `Log`, `Notify`). Wrap the run with `begin deploy "Deploy" --total 4` at Step 3 kickoff (Steps 0–1 are parse/detect, near-instant) and `end deploy --status ok|fail` after Step 6. Replace all hand-written `telegram-ping.sh` calls below with the corresponding helper subcommand.

## Usage

```
/deploy           → deploy to nonprod (staging/dev)
/deploy nonprod   → same as above
/deploy prod      → deploy to production
```

## Deploy kinds

The skill reads `.claude/deploy.json` for project-specific config. The top-level `kind` field selects the deploy flavor:

- **`firebase`** (default when `kind` is missing — back-compat with every existing `deploy.json`) — runs the Firebase CLI flow (tests → build → `firebase deploy`).
- **`local-script`** — runs the project's own shell commands locally (no Firebase, no cloud). Use this for projects whose "deploy" is a local rebuild + daemon restart, a docker restart, or any other shell-driven flow.

Other kinds (`docker`, `vercel`, etc.) are reserved for future additions. Adding a new kind = add a branch under each step that needs it + a schema example at the bottom.

## Invocation

When `/deploy` is called, execute the full pipeline below. Do NOT prompt for confirmation — if checks pass, deploy proceeds.

## Pipeline

### Step 0 — Parse arguments

- No argument or `nonprod` → target = `nonprod`
- `prod` → target = `prod`

### Step 1 — Detect project and load config

1. Determine the current project from the working directory.
2. Look for `.claude/deploy.json` in the project root.
3. **If `deploy.json` exists:** load it. Read top-level `kind` field — default to `"firebase"` if absent (back-compat). Then validate (Step 1b).
4. **If `deploy.json` does not exist:** check for deployment config files (`.firebaserc`, `firebase.json`, `Dockerfile`, `vercel.json`, etc.).
   - If `.firebaserc` / `firebase.json` found → auto-generate `deploy.json` with `kind: "firebase"` (see Firebase schema below), save it, continue.
   - Otherwise → exit with: "No deployment target configured for this project. To enable deploys, add `.claude/deploy.json` (set `kind: \"local-script\"` for non-cloud projects) or a `.firebaserc` (Firebase)."

Note: `local-script` projects MUST have a hand-written `deploy.json` — there is no auto-detection, because the commands are project-specific.

### Step 1b — Validate deploy.json against project files

**`kind: "firebase"`:**

- Read `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json`.
- Check that aliases in `deploy.json.environments` match `.firebaserc.projects`.
- Check that services in `deploy.json.services` match what's configured in `firebase.json` (hosting, functions, firestore, storage).
- If drift detected → auto-update `deploy.json`, note what changed in output, continue.

**`kind: "local-script"`:**

- No external config to validate against. Confirm required fields are present:
  - `environments` (with at least one entry flagged `nonprod: true`)
  - `testCommands` (array, may be empty if the project has no test gate)
  - `buildCommands` (object keyed by environment name)
  - `deployCommands` (object keyed by environment name, must contain at least one command for the resolved target)
- If a required field is missing or `deployCommands[<target>]` is empty, exit with a clear error naming the missing field. Do not silently default.

Preserve any user-customized fields (e.g., custom `testCommands`, `buildCommands`, `acknowledgedGaps`).

### Step 2 — Resolve environment

Using `deploy.json.environments`:
- If target is `nonprod` → use the environment where `"nonprod": true`.
- If target is `prod` → use the environment where `"prod": true`.

For `kind: "firebase"`, read the resolved `alias` and `projectId` for subsequent steps.
For `kind: "local-script"`, the environment key itself (e.g. `"local"`) is the label used in logs + notifications — there's no cloud project ID.

### Step 3 — Pre-deploy checks

**Announce start:** `~/.claude/scripts/pipeline-step.sh begin deploy "Deploy" --total 4` (covers Steps 3, 4, 5, 6).
**Announce step:** `~/.claude/scripts/pipeline-step.sh start deploy "Pre-Deploy Checks" --index 1`

Run these in order. If any fail, call `pipeline-step.sh fail deploy "Pre-Deploy Checks" "<reason>"`, then `pipeline-step.sh end deploy --status fail`, and stop.

**`kind: "firebase"`:**

1. **Firebase CLI check:** Run `npx firebase-tools@latest --version` to verify firebase tools are available.
2. **Auth check:** Run `npx firebase-tools@latest projects:list --json 2>/dev/null | head -5` to verify authentication. If this fails, report the auth issue and stop.
3. **Run tests:** Execute each command in `deploy.json.testCommands` sequentially. If any test command fails, stop.
4. **Run build:** Execute each command in `deploy.json.buildCommands[<target>]` sequentially. If build fails, stop.
5. **Env file verification:** If `deploy.json.envFiles` is set for this target, verify those files exist and spot-check that they reference the correct project ID (grep for the project ID in the env file).

**`kind: "local-script"`:**

1. **Run tests:** Execute each command in `deploy.json.testCommands` sequentially. **BLOCKING** — broken tests = no deploy. (Skip this step ONLY if `testCommands` is an empty array, signalling the project has no test gate by design.)
2. **Run build:** Execute each command in `deploy.json.buildCommands[<target>]` sequentially. If build fails, stop.

On success: `pipeline-step.sh done deploy "Pre-Deploy Checks" --note "tests + build verified"`.

### Step 4 — Deploy

**Announce step:** `~/.claude/scripts/pipeline-step.sh start deploy "Deploy" --index 2 --note "<env-label> (<nonprod|prod>)"`

**`kind: "firebase"`:**

1. **Switch alias:** `npx firebase-tools@latest use <alias>`
2. **Deploy:** `npx firebase-tools@latest deploy --project <alias>` — this deploys all configured services. If the project uses hosting targets (see `deploy.json.hostingTarget`), use `--only hosting:<target>,functions,firestore` as appropriate.
3. **Post-deploy script (if configured):** Run `deploy.json.postDeploy[<target>]` commands (e.g., monitoring setup).

**`kind: "local-script"`:**

1. **Run deploy commands:** Execute each entry in `deploy.json.deployCommands[<target>]` sequentially. Any non-zero exit fails the step.
2. **Post-deploy script (if configured):** Run `deploy.json.postDeploy[<target>]` commands. Typically empty for local-script projects, but available for smoke-checks or notifications.

On success: `pipeline-step.sh done deploy "Deploy" --note "<services-or-label>"`.
On failure: `pipeline-step.sh fail deploy "Deploy" "<reason>"`, then `end deploy --status fail`.

### Step 5 — Log

**Announce step:** `~/.claude/scripts/pipeline-step.sh start deploy "Log" --index 3`

Append a row to `DEPLOYMENTS.md` in the project root. Create the file if it doesn't exist. Format:

```markdown
| <date> | <env-label> | <commit-short-hash> | <branch> | <deployed> | <status> |
```

Where:
- `<date>` = ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- `<env-label>` = Firebase alias for `kind: "firebase"`; environment key (e.g. `"local"`) for `kind: "local-script"`
- `<commit-short-hash>` = `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
- `<branch>` = `git branch --show-current`
- `<deployed>` = comma-separated services list for `kind: "firebase"`; for `kind: "local-script"`, the literal label `local-script` optionally suffixed with `:<deploy.json.label>` if the project set one (e.g. `local-script:daemon-restart`)
- `<status>` = `success` or `failed: <reason>`

If the file doesn't have a table header yet, prepend:
```markdown
# Deployments

| Date | Env | Commit | Branch | Deployed | Status |
|------|-----|--------|--------|----------|--------|
```

On completion: `pipeline-step.sh done deploy "Log" --note "<commit-short-hash>, <branch>"`.

### Step 6 — Notify

**Announce step:** `~/.claude/scripts/pipeline-step.sh start deploy "Notify" --index 4`

Do nothing specific in this step beyond the helper call — the pipeline-step helper already sends a telegram message. Use the `--note` field on `end` to carry the extra context (`<project-name> to <env-label>`, commit hash, branch).

- **On success:** `pipeline-step.sh done deploy "Notify"`, then `pipeline-step.sh end deploy --status ok --note "<project-name> to <env-label> (<nonprod|prod>). Commit: <short-hash>, Branch: <branch>"`.
- **On failure:** `pipeline-step.sh fail deploy "Notify" "<failure-reason>"`, then `pipeline-step.sh end deploy --status fail --note "<project-name> to <env-label>. <failure-reason>"`.

## deploy.json — `kind: "firebase"` schema

```jsonc
{
  // Auto-detected, do not edit
  "platform": "firebase",
  "projectName": "HabitTracker",
  "kind": "firebase",   // optional — defaults to "firebase" when absent

  // Environment map — derived from .firebaserc
  "environments": {
    "staging": {
      "alias": "staging",
      "projectId": "habit-tracker-staging-3fd56",
      "nonprod": true
    },
    "default": {
      "alias": "default",
      "projectId": "habit-tracker-54d52",
      "prod": true
    }
  },

  // Services to deploy — derived from firebase.json
  "services": ["hosting", "functions", "firestore"],

  // Optional: hosting target name (for projects using Firebase hosting targets)
  "hostingTarget": null,

  // Test commands — run before every deploy (both nonprod and prod)
  "testCommands": [
    "npm -w packages/core run test",
    "npm -w apps/web run test:run",
    "npm -w functions run test:unit"
  ],

  // Build commands — per target environment
  "buildCommands": {
    "nonprod": ["npm -w apps/web run build:staging"],
    "prod": ["npm -w apps/web run build:prod"]
  },

  // Optional: env files to verify per target
  "envFiles": {
    "nonprod": [".env.staging"],
    "prod": [".env.production"]
  },

  // Optional: post-deploy commands per target
  "postDeploy": {
    "nonprod": [],
    "prod": ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.gcp/habit-tracker-54d52.json FIRESTORE_PROJECT=habit-tracker-54d52 node scripts/setup-monitoring.js"]
  },

  // Auto-managed: services in firebase.json that are absent — flagged once, not re-asked
  "acknowledgedGaps": []
}
```

### Firebase auto-generation rules

When generating `deploy.json` from project files (Firebase-only — `local-script` projects must be configured by hand):

**Environments:** Read `.firebaserc.projects`. Heuristic for nonprod/prod assignment:
- Alias names containing `staging`, `dev`, `development`, `test` → `nonprod: true`
- Alias names containing `prod`, `production`, `default` → `prod: true`
- If ambiguous, assign the first alias as nonprod and flag for user review.

**Services:** Read `firebase.json` top-level keys. Map:
- `hosting` key present → `"hosting"`
- `functions` key present → `"functions"`
- `firestore` key present → `"firestore"`
- `storage` key present → `"storage"`

If `firebase.json` exists but is missing commonly expected services (e.g., has hosting but no functions), note it in output: "firebase.json has no functions configured — deploying hosting + firestore only. Update firebase.json if this is incorrect." Add the missing service to `acknowledgedGaps` so this message is not repeated.

**Test commands:** Scan for test infrastructure:
- `package.json` with `test` or `test:run` scripts → include them
- `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` with pytest config → include `pytest`
- Monorepo workspaces → include test commands for each workspace that has tests

**Build commands:** Scan `package.json` for build scripts:
- If environment-specific builds exist (`build:staging`, `build:prod`) → map to nonprod/prod
- If only a generic `build` script → use it for both
- If no build script (e.g., Python-only projects) → empty array

**Post-deploy:** Check `package.json` for `deploy:staging` / `deploy:prod` scripts and extract any post-firebase-deploy commands. Otherwise empty.

## deploy.json — `kind: "local-script"` schema

```jsonc
{
  "project": "conversational-assistant",
  "kind": "local-script",

  // Optional one-word descriptor that appears in the DEPLOYMENTS.md log
  // row as `local-script:<label>` — makes the deploy intent recognizable
  // at a glance (e.g. `daemon-restart`, `docker-rebuild`, `pm2-reload`).
  "label": "daemon-restart",

  // Environment map. For local-script, the env key is just a label —
  // no alias/projectId required (Firebase-shaped fields are ignored if
  // present). Same nonprod / prod booleans as the firebase schema.
  // Phase-1 single-env setups can flag the same env as both nonprod and
  // prod until a real env split exists.
  "environments": {
    "local": { "nonprod": true, "prod": true }
  },

  // Test commands — BLOCKING on any failure. Empty array = no test gate
  // (skip Step 3.1 entirely; intentional opt-out, not a missing field).
  "testCommands": ["npm test"],

  // Build commands per target environment.
  "buildCommands": {
    "local": ["npm run build"]
  },

  // Deploy commands per target environment — the local-script-specific
  // field. Each entry is a shell command; they run sequentially, any
  // non-zero exit fails the deploy.
  "deployCommands": {
    "local": ["aide daemon stop", "aide daemon start"]
  },

  // Optional post-deploy commands per target (smoke checks, etc.).
  "postDeploy": {
    "local": []
  }
}
```

## Non-deployable projects

If invoked with no `.claude/deploy.json` AND no Firebase config:
- Output: "No deployment target configured for this project. To enable deploys, add `.claude/deploy.json` (set `kind: \"local-script\"` for non-cloud projects) or a `.firebaserc` (Firebase)."
- Do not create `deploy.json`.
- Do not ping telegram.

## Notes

- Never prompt for confirmation. If checks pass, deploy.
- Never re-ask about acknowledged gaps in `deploy.json.acknowledgedGaps` (Firebase only).
- The `deploy.json` file should be committed to the repo — it contains no secrets.
- Firebase: use `npx firebase-tools@latest` rather than assuming `firebase` is on PATH.
- For prod deploys, include a note in the output: "Deploying to PRODUCTION" — but do not block or ask for confirmation.
- If telegram ping fails (script missing, no token), log the failure but continue the deploy — notifications are best-effort.
